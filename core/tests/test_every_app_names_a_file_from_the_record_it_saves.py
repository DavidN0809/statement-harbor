"""Every app names a file from the record it writes down for that file.

Rename reads a File names pattern's {number} from a file's saved record,
the order number else the document id, and what tells the second of two
files of one name apart, the order number else the last six of the id
(naming.fields_of, renaming.told_apart_by, renaming.run_for). A download
that named a file from anything else gave a file a name Rename then
offered to change.

Anthem takes its member documents, ID cards and letters each from a list
of its own, apart from its EOBs, and saves them in one loop
(anthem_docs.App._save_collected). That loop named a file from the row
the list gave, which carries the id as "doc_id", and wrote down a record
carrying it as "document_id", with no id handed to unique_path. So under a
pattern with {number}, Rename offered to add an id each of those files was
saved without, and the second of two files of one name, saved " (2)" by
the download, was offered the end of its id.

Each list here holds two documents that want one name. Anthem's code
gives the type codes "1095B" and "1095" one label, tells a member's cards
of one kind apart only by their order, and names a letter by its subject,
so two letters of one subject on one day share a name. Each is listed by
Anthem's own code from what its site hands it and saved by its own loop,
with only the provider's answers stood in, and then its own Rename runs.
Anthem's EOBs were already named from the record they are written down
by, and a test here keeps them so.

Every other app names a file from the object it writes down, which the
census at the end holds every app to.
