"""A receipt set aside stays set aside on another computer.

A receipt whose page showed nothing on three separate days is set aside as
No Receipt Available, and the record keeps those days (not_shown_days).
Meijer holds the purchase final only while the record holds three days,
since Meijer does not take No Receipt Available as final otherwise, and
every receipt app's skip line says a purchase set aside was skipped for
that, by the days too. tools/migrate.py --minimal carried only the fields
it listed, which left the days out, so on the new computer Meijer asked
for every receipt set aside again and the other apps said each one was
"Already completed and PDF verified", the words a tester was told for a
receipt never saved (#70). An import into an install that already knew
the purchase took the state and left the days behind, the same way.

These set a purchase aside with each receipt app's own downloader over an
output folder on disk, three days of the core's tried_again, move the
history with the tool and ask the app's own _already_done and the core's
skip line on the new computer. Every name and number is invented.
