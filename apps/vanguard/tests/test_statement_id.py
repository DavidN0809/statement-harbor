"""The id Vanguard's statements API gives a statement is not kept, for now.

The statements API answers each statement with a statementId. The listing
hands it over as statement_id, which the record does not read, so every
record keeps document_id empty. A download puts the end of a record's id
in a file's name when another file has the name, and a File names
pattern's {number} is the whole id. Nobody here has a Vanguard account,
so whether the id stays the same from one listing to the next, and ends
differently for each statement, has not been seen, and the contributor
is being asked. Until then a second statement wanting a name another file
has is told apart by " (2)", as in every app that keeps no id, and these
tests say so, so that keeping the id is a change made on purpose.

Each test runs Vanguard's own Discover, with only the page's own API
answer stood in, and its own download_one up to the moment it asks
unique_path for a name. Every account and id is invented."""
